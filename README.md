# StockPricePrediction

This is a stock price movement tool developed for cohort 1 of TechWise in the US as a capstone project. 

There are 3 separate models, main.py being our first attempt using an LSTM, upordown.py being our second attempt using a simple RFE model, and model.py being our third attempt using an RFE that is much more developed.

If you are going to try and use this tool for yourself I would recommend the third iteration, model.py. To use it you first need to run model.py with the selected stocks that you would like to train the model with, then take the selected features and input those as the parameters for riseorfall.py. Then you can run riseorfall.py and get a prediction for whatever stocks you'd like!

Please remember that none of this is financial advice and is simply a tool we designed to help grow our competency in machine learning, 

Thank you.
